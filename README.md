Clustering and presenting the reduced dimensional view of responses to an electronic nose exposed to various edible substances

- 2016-12-13  Added clustering methods {Affinity propagation, Mean-shift, and DBSCAN} and ptimized their parameters; plot funct improv
- 2016-12-12  Made to plot functions and aesthetics of plots and organization and removed the redundant Milks2 database from analysis
- 2016-12-5   Small correction to js cell togle hiding-showing input code
- 2016-12-4   Added K-Means clustering, it's K finding, and plots comparing with known sample ids. Cleaned up plots aesthetics tweaked plot function. Started writing report
- 2016-12-3   Placed project on GitHub repository
- 2016-11-30  Began applying PCA to the data
- 2016-11-7   Began project, reading databse into dataframes and cleaning up the data
